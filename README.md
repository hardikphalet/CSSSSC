# The Computer Science Society, St. Stephen's College

This project, begun in 2020, is an effort to revamp the society's old website using the relatively new Python framework [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

The module that it uses to handle the database required for this project is the [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) module.

We're also using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework to structure our HTML/CSS, and in particular [this](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/clean-blog/) theme

If you find any bugs in this project, please raise an Issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/hardikphalet/CSSSSC/issues) page, or if it's a security issue, send an email to computer.society.ssc@gmail.com with the subject line WEBSITE SECURITY ISSUE, and a description of the issue.

Thank you for taking the time to look through this project.

We're currently hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://cssssc.pythonanywhere.com), and if you don't see anything there yet, please bear with us while we work to upload and deliver content from the tech-minded folks at St. Stephen's College.
